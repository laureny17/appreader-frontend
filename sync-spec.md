# Synchronization Specification

**Purpose:** This document describes all backend synchronizations that handle authentication and authorization for excluded API routes.

---

## Important Limitation

**Query methods (methods starting with `_`) cannot be excluded or handled by syncs** because:

- The engine treats all methods starting with `_` as queries
- Queries are not instrumented as actions and cannot be called in sync `then` clauses
- Therefore, all query endpoints remain **included** (passthrough) and concepts verify authorization internally

**Only non-`_` prefixed actions can be excluded and handled by syncs.**

---

## Overview

The backend uses a synchronization-based authentication system. Certain **action** routes have been **excluded** from direct passthrough and instead require authentication via synchronizations. When a request hits an excluded route, it triggers a `Requesting.request` action that is caught by syncs, which:

1. Verify the caller's identity and permissions
2. Call the actual concept action if authorized
3. Return the response via `Requesting.respond`

**Critical Requirement:** All excluded routes now require a `caller` parameter in the request body representing the authenticated user ID.

---

# EventDirectory Admin Action Syncs

All EventDirectory admin **actions** (non-`_` prefixed) are excluded and handled by syncs. These syncs verify that the caller is an admin before executing the action.

## Common Pattern

All EventDirectory admin action syncs follow this pattern:

1. **Request Sync**: Catches `Requesting.request`, verifies caller is admin via `verifyAdmin` helper, then calls the concept action
2. **Response Syncs**: Two separate syncs handle success and error responses:
   - **ResponseSuccess**: Catches successful action result (`{}`) and responds via `Requesting.respond`
   - **ResponseError**: Catches error result (`{ error }`) and responds via `Requesting.respond`

**Exception:** `createEvent` uses a single combined Response sync that handles both success (`{ event }`) and error (`{ error }`).

**Authentication Requirement:** `caller` must be an admin (verified via `EventDirectory._isAdmin` returning array `[{ isAdmin: true }]`)

# Query Endpoints (Cannot Be Excluded)

The following endpoints **cannot be excluded** because they are queries (start with `_`):

## AuthAccounts Queries

- `POST /api/AuthAccounts/_getAccountByUserId` - Concept verifies caller owns account or is admin
- `POST /api/AuthAccounts/_getAccountByEmail` - Concept verifies caller owns account or is admin
- `POST /api/AuthAccounts/_getAllUsers` - Concept verifies caller is admin

## EventDirectory Queries

- `POST /api/EventDirectory/getAllEvents` - Concept verifies caller is admin (note: doesn't start with `_` but is treated as a query and is included)

## ApplicationStorage Queries/Actions (named with `_` prefix)

- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_bulkImportApplications` - Concept verifies importedBy is admin
- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_getFlaggedApplications` - Concept verifies caller is admin
- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_disqualifyApplication` - Concept verifies disqualifiedBy is admin
- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_removeFlag` - Concept verifies removedBy is admin
- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_undisqualifyApplication` - Concept verifies undisqualifiedBy is admin
- `POST /api/ApplicationStorage/_getDisqualifiedApplications` - Concept verifies caller is admin

**Note:** These remain included (passthrough) and concepts verify authorization internally. They do **not** require a `caller` parameter for sync-based authentication, but may require it for concept-level verification.

---

## Summary

### Endpoints with Syncs (Excluded)

- **8 EventDirectory admin actions** (excluded and handled by syncs):

  1. `createEvent`
  2. `activateEvent`
  3. `inactivateEvent`
  4. `updateEventConfig`
  5. `addReader`
  6. `removeReader`
  7. `addAdmin`
  8. `removeAdmin`

- **Total: 23 syncs**:
  - `createEvent`: 2 syncs (Request + combined Response handling both success/error)
  - Other 7 actions: 21 syncs (7 × 3: Request + ResponseSuccess + ResponseError)

### Endpoints Without Syncs (Included/Passthrough)

- All query endpoints (methods starting with `_`) - **cannot be excluded due to engine limitations**
- All ApplicationStorage methods starting with `_` (treated as queries by engine)
- `getAllEvents` (included, concept handles auth)
- All other non-excluded endpoints

**Important:** Query endpoints remain included because the engine treats methods starting with `_` as queries, and queries cannot be called in sync `then` clauses. These endpoints rely on concept-level authorization.

### Response Formats

**No changes** - All response formats remain identical to api-spec.md. Syncs only add authentication checks; they don't modify the API contract for responses.

### Authentication Failures

- **Excluded routes (sync-based):** If authentication fails (caller is not authorized), the request will timeout with no response (504 Gateway Timeout). The frontend should handle this appropriately.
- **Included query endpoints (concept-based):** Authentication failures are handled by the concepts and return normal error responses with `{ "error": "string" }`.

### Why Only 8 Actions Have Syncs?

The engine has a technical limitation: **methods starting with `_` are treated as queries and cannot be called in sync `then` clauses**. This means:

- ❌ Query endpoints (e.g., `_getAccountByUserId`) **cannot** be excluded or have syncs
- ❌ ApplicationStorage methods like `_bulkImportApplications` **cannot** be excluded (they start with `_`)
- ✅ Only non-`_` prefixed **actions** can be excluded and have syncs
- ✅ EventDirectory admin actions (e.g., `createEvent`, `addReader`) don't start with `_`, so they **can** be excluded and have syncs

This is why only the 8 EventDirectory admin actions have syncs - they're the only admin-only actions that don't start with `_`.

# ReviewRecords User Action Syncs

All ReviewRecords critical user **actions** listed below are excluded and handled by syncs. These syncs verify that the HTTP `caller` matches the user parameter in the action (`caller === author` or `caller === user`).

## Common Pattern

All ReviewRecords user action syncs follow this pattern:

1. **Request Sync**: Catches `Requesting.request`, verifies `caller === author/user` via `verifyCaller` helper, then calls the concept action
2. **Response Syncs**: Two separate syncs handle success and error responses:
   - **ResponseSuccess**: Catches successful action result and responds via `Requesting.respond`
   - **ResponseError**: Catches error result (`{ error }`) and responds via `Requesting.respond`

**Authentication Requirement:** `caller` must match the user parameter (`author` or `user`) in the action (verified via `verifyCaller` helper)

---

2. **Response Syncs**: Two separate syncs handle success and error responses:
   - **ResponseSuccess**: Catches successful action result and responds via `Requesting.respond`
